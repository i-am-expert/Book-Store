### Book-Store

A web-application built using **Nodejs**, **MongoDB**, **Expressjs**, where you can add, delete, modify, search various information about different books and different authors, **upload book cover images** (using FilePond), and can do more stuff.

Super cool **User Interface** and the data is stored on the **cloud** (using **MongoDB Atlas**).
